# OpenClaw / Agent Skill Convention vs AgentSkills Marketplace: Format Comparison

This document provides a comprehensive comparison between the **Agent Skill Convention** (the open standard used by OpenClaw/ClawHub, Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and others) and the **AgentSkills Marketplace** (agentskills.cv) skill format.

---

## 1. Format Comparison

### 1.1 SKILL.md YAML Frontmatter

#### Agent Skill Convention (OpenClaw / Vercel `skills`)

| Field | Required | Constraints | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | 1-64 chars, lowercase alphanumeric + single hyphens, no start/end hyphens, no consecutive hyphens, **must match parent directory name** | Unique identifier for the skill |
| `description` | Yes | Max 1024 chars, single-line string | What the skill does and when to use it. Loaded into agent context for relevance determination |
| `allowed-tools` | No | Comma-separated list or YAML list | Tools the skill is permitted to use (e.g., `Bash`, `Read`, `Grep`, `Write`, `WebSearch`) |
| `model` | No | Model identifier string | Specifies a particular AI model for execution |
| `requirements.bins` | No | YAML list | External binaries the skill depends on (e.g., `gh`, `docker`). Skill remains inactive if missing |
| `requirements.env` | No | YAML list | Environment variables required (e.g., API keys) |
| `requirements.config` | No | YAML list | Configuration flags required |
| `metadata.openclaw.emoji` | No | Single emoji | Visual identifier in OpenClaw UI |
| `metadata.openclaw.bins` | No | YAML list | OpenClaw-specific binary requirements |
| `metadata.openclaw.install` | No | Object by OS | OS-specific install instructions (e.g., `brew` for macOS) |

**Example:**
```yaml
---
name: github-pr-review
description: "Performs automated code review on GitHub pull requests, checking for common issues and suggesting improvements."
allowed-tools: Bash, Read, Grep, Write
requirements:
  bins:
    - gh
  env:
    - GITHUB_TOKEN
metadata:
  openclaw:
    emoji: "\U0001F50D"
    install:
      darwin:
        brew: gh
---
```

#### AgentSkills Marketplace (Current)

| Field | Required | Constraints | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Kebab-case recommended, no strict validation | Short identifier for the skill |
| `description` | Yes | One-line, in quotes | When the agent should use this skill |
| `license` | No | SPDX identifier | Only if user specifies a preference |

**Example (generated by AI Skill Composer):**
```yaml
---
name: code-reviewer
description: "Reviews code for common issues and suggests improvements."
---
```

**Key Differences:**
- The convention enforces **strict naming validation** (1-64 chars, lowercase, hyphen rules, directory name match). Our platform has no such validation.
- The convention supports **`allowed-tools`** for sandboxing/permission control. We have no equivalent.
- The convention has a **`requirements` system** for declaring prerequisites. We lack this entirely.
- The convention includes **`metadata` extensibility** for platform-specific data. We store parsed frontmatter as opaque JSON (`skillMdParsed`).
- Convention's `description` field is specifically designed for **agent context loading** (token-efficient relevance matching). Our description is for human display.

### 1.2 Markdown Body Structure

#### Agent Skill Convention

The body provides step-by-step instructions loaded into the agent's context when the skill is activated. It can include:
- Direct copy-and-paste terminal commands
- References to bundled scripts in `scripts/`
- References to domain knowledge in `references/`
- Concrete input/output examples
- No restrictions on markdown content (this is also a security concern)

#### AgentSkills Marketplace (AI Composer Output)

Our generated SKILL.md follows this structure:
- `# Title` heading
- Brief introduction paragraph
- `## When to Use` section
- `## Workflow` section with step-by-step process
- `## Example Usage` with code blocks
- `## Bundled Resources` (optional, if resources are generated)

**Key Difference:** The convention body is designed to be **machine-consumed** (loaded into an agent's system prompt). Our body is formatted more for **human readability** with structured sections.

### 1.3 Directory Structure

#### Agent Skill Convention

```
skill-name/
  SKILL.md              # Required: instructions + frontmatter
  scripts/              # Optional: executable code (Python, Bash, etc.)
    helper.py
    validate.sh
  references/           # Optional: documentation loaded into context
    api-schema.md
    coding-standards.md
  assets/               # Optional: templates, configs, boilerplate
    template.json
```

**Critical constraint:** The directory name MUST match the `name` field in frontmatter.

#### AgentSkills Marketplace

```
skill-name/
  SKILL.md              # Main content
  scripts/              # Optional: generated by AI Composer
  references/           # Optional: generated by AI Composer
  assets/               # Optional: generated by AI Composer
```

Our AI Composer can generate `resources` alongside SKILL.md (stored in `skillCreationOutputs.resourcesJson`), but the directory structure is not enforced at the platform level. Skills are stored as:
- `r2FileKey` pointing to a ZIP in Cloudflare R2 (GitHub-sourced skills)
- `skillMdContent` as raw text in D1 (user-created skills)

---

## 2. Ecosystem Differences

### 2.1 ClawHub (OpenClaw's Registry)

| Feature | ClawHub | AgentSkills Marketplace |
|---------|---------|------------------------|
| **URL** | clawhub.ai | agentskills.cv |
| **Skill Count** | 3,000+ (as of Feb 2026) | 770+ |
| **Source** | Community-published to `github.com/openclaw/skills` | GitHub aggregation + AI Composer |
| **Installation** | CLI: `npx clawhub@latest install <slug>` | ZIP download, manual installation |
| **Search** | Categorized browsing | Search, category filter, sorting |
| **Ratings** | None (trust-based) | 5-star rating system |
| **Favorites** | None | User favorites |
| **Skill Creation** | Manual (submit to GitHub repo) | AI Skill Composer (natural language) |
| **Auth** | GitHub-based | Google OAuth 2.0 |
| **Security** | Community review, no formal audit | No security scanning |
| **Agent Detection** | Auto-detects installed agents | Not applicable (web-only) |

### 2.2 Vercel `skills` CLI

Vercel has released a separate `skills` npm package that acts as a package manager for agent skills:
- `npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills` to install
- Auto-detects agent configuration directories (`.claude/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, etc.)
- Uses a central `.agents/skills/` directory with copies/symlinks to agent-specific paths
- Supports global (`~/.claude/skills/`) and project-level installation

**Our platform has no CLI tool.** Users download ZIPs and manually place files.

---

## 3. Skill Capabilities and Execution Model

### 3.1 How Convention Skills Execute

1. **Discovery:** Agent scans skill directories (`~/.claude/skills/`, `<project>/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`)
2. **Context Loading:** Only the frontmatter description (30-50 tokens) is initially loaded into the system prompt
3. **Activation:** When the agent determines a skill is relevant to the current task, it loads the full SKILL.md body (500-5000 tokens)
4. **Tool Restriction:** If `allowed-tools` is specified, the agent is restricted to only those tools during skill execution
5. **Prerequisites Check:** If `requirements.bins` lists a binary that is not installed, the skill remains inactive
6. **Script Execution:** The agent can execute bundled scripts via `Bash` tool calls

**Token Efficiency:** This progressive disclosure model (metadata-first, full-content-on-demand) is a core design principle. It avoids flooding the context window with irrelevant instructions.

### 3.2 How Our Skills Work

1. **Discovery:** Users browse/search the web marketplace
2. **Download:** User downloads a ZIP file
3. **Manual Installation:** User places files in their agent's skill directory
4. **No Runtime Integration:** Our platform has no awareness of how skills are loaded or used by agents

**Gap:** We have no mechanism for progressive disclosure, tool restriction, or prerequisite checking. We are a content marketplace, not a runtime platform.

### 3.3 Skills vs Slash Commands

The convention distinguishes between:
- **Skills:** Automatically invoked by the agent when contextually relevant. Token-efficient (progressive disclosure).
- **Slash Commands:** Manually invoked by the user (e.g., `/review`, `/commit`). Full template loaded on every invocation (100-1000 tokens).

Our platform does not distinguish between these two types. All entries are treated as "skills" regardless of their intended invocation model.

---

## 4. Compatibility Analysis

### 4.1 Shared Open Standard

The Agent Skill Convention is an open standard originally created by Anthropic. It has been adopted by:
- Claude Code (Anthropic)
- Codex CLI (OpenAI)
- Cursor
- GitHub Copilot (Microsoft)
- Antigravity (Google DeepMind)
- Gemini CLI (Google)
- OpenCode
- OpenClaw/Moltbot

**Our platform already generates SKILL.md files that are compatible with this standard.** The AI Composer output includes:
- YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`
- Structured markdown body
- Optional resource files (`scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`)

### 4.2 Compatibility Gaps

| Feature | Convention Standard | Our Implementation | Gap |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|-----|
| `name` validation | Strict (1-64 chars, lowercase, hyphens, dir match) | No validation | Need to add validation |
| `description` constraints | Max 1024 chars, single-line | No constraints | Need to add validation |
| `allowed-tools` | Supported | Not generated | Should support in Composer |
| `requirements` | `bins`, `env`, `config` | Not supported | Should support in Composer |
| `metadata` | Extensible (OpenClaw-specific fields) | Not supported | Optional, low priority |
| Directory name match | Enforced | Not enforced | Should enforce on publish |
| `model` field | Supported | Not generated | Optional, low priority |

### 4.3 Cross-Platform Installation Paths

Skills from our platform need to be placed in the correct directory for each agent:

| Agent | Project-Level Path | Global Path |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/` | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/skills/` | `~/.cursor/skills/` |
| Codex CLI | `.codex/skills/` | `~/.codex/skills/` |
| OpenClaw | `skills/` | `~/.clawdbot/skills/` |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/skills/` | `~/.opencode/skills/` |

---

## 5. Discovery and Loading Mechanisms

### 5.1 Convention (Agent-Side)

```
Agent starts
  -> Scans skill directories (global + project)
  -> Reads SKILL.md frontmatter from each skill directory
  -> Loads descriptions into system prompt metadata (~30-50 tokens each)
  -> User sends a message
  -> Agent evaluates which skills are relevant based on descriptions
  -> Loads full SKILL.md body for relevant skills (~500-5000 tokens)
  -> Executes instructions using allowed tools
  -> Checks prerequisites before activation
```

### 5.2 Our Platform (Marketplace-Side)

```
User browses agentskills.cv
  -> Searches/filters by category, rating, stars
  -> Views skill detail page (SKILL.md preview, file tree, stats)
  -> Downloads ZIP
  -> Manually extracts to agent's skill directory
  -> Agent discovers and loads as per convention
```

### 5.3 ClawHub (Registry + CLI)

```
User runs: npx clawhub@latest install <slug>
  -> CLI fetches skill from ClawHub registry
  -> CLI detects installed agents
  -> Copies skill directory to each agent's skill path
  -> Agent discovers and loads as per convention
```

**Gap:** Our platform lacks a CLI installer that can auto-detect agents and place skills in the correct directories. Users must manually handle installation.

---

## 6. Prerequisites System

### 6.1 Convention Requirements

The convention supports three types of prerequisites in YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
requirements:
  bins:
    - gh          # GitHub CLI must be installed
    - docker      # Docker must be available
  env:
    - GITHUB_TOKEN    # Environment variable must be set
    - AWS_ACCESS_KEY  # AWS credentials required
  config:
    - git.user.name   # Git config must be set
```

**Behavior:** If any prerequisite is not met, the skill remains inactive (not loaded into context). The agent does not attempt to execute it.

### 6.2 Our Platform

We have **no prerequisites system**. Skills are presented without any indication of what external tools, environment variables, or configuration they require.

**Impact:** Users may download and install a skill that requires `gh` CLI, only to find it does not work because `gh` is not installed. There is no feedback mechanism.

### 6.3 OpenClaw-Specific Extensions

OpenClaw extends the prerequisites system with platform-specific install instructions:

```yaml
metadata:
  openclaw:
    install:
      darwin:
        brew: gh
      linux:
        apt: gh
```

This allows the agent to suggest or automatically install missing prerequisites.

## 7. Security Considerations

### 7.1 Convention Security Risks

The Agent Skill Convention has **significant security concerns** that have been documented:

1. **Malware Distribution:** Hundreds of malicious skills have been found in ClawHub's registry, including staged malware delivery chains disguised as legitimate skills. A top-downloaded skill was found to install macOS infostealing malware.

2. **Unrestricted Markdown Body:** The specification places no restrictions on the markdown body. Skills can include:
   - Shell commands that users are instructed to copy-paste
   - Bundled scripts that execute outside the agent's tool boundary
   - Instructions to download and run external binaries

3. **Social Engineering:** Skills can instruct users to install "prerequisites" that are actually the point of compromise (e.g., downloading password-protected ZIP files).

4. **Supply Chain Risk:** The skill registry functions like an app store, but packages are documentation that users instinctively trust and execute.

5. **Prompt Injection:** Skills loaded into agent context can contain prompt injection attacks that bypass safety guidelines.

### 7.2 Our Platform's Security Posture

| Concern | Convention/ClawHub | Our Platform |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Malware scanning | None (community review only) | None |
| Script sandboxing | Via `allowed-tools` (optional) | Not applicable |
| Content review | Manual review before publishing to registry | No review process |
| Prompt injection detection | None | None |
| User warnings | "Review before installing" disclaimer | None |
| Code signing | None | None |

### 7.3 Recommended Security Measures

For importing OpenClaw/convention skills into our marketplace, we should implement:

1. **Static analysis of SKILL.md body** for suspicious patterns:
   - `curl | sh` or `wget | bash` patterns
   - Base64-encoded content
   - Downloads of executables
   - Password-protected archives
   - Obfuscated shell commands

2. **Script scanning** for bundled scripts:
   - Network calls to unknown domains
   - File system access outside skill directory
   - Credential harvesting patterns
   - Process spawning

3. **Frontmatter validation** ensuring:
   - `name` follows convention rules
   - `description` is within length limits
   - `allowed-tools` only references known tools
   - `requirements.bins` only references known safe binaries

4. **Trust signals** in the UI:
   - Verified author badges
   - Community audit status
   - Download/rating counts
   - Last security scan date

---

## 8. Database Schema Implications

### 8.1 Current Schema (`skills` table)

Our current `skills` table stores:
- `skillMdContent` (raw SKILL.md text)
- `skillMdParsed` (parsed frontmatter as JSON string)

These fields can already store convention-format skills. However, the parsed frontmatter is treated as opaque JSON with no structured access to convention-specific fields.

### 8.2 Recommended Schema Extensions

To properly support convention skills, consider adding columns or structured parsing for:

```
allowed_tools      TEXT    -- Comma-separated list from frontmatter
required_bins      TEXT    -- JSON array from requirements.bins
required_env       TEXT    -- JSON array from requirements.env
required_config    TEXT    -- JSON array from requirements.config
skill_type         TEXT    -- 'skill' | 'slash-command'
source_registry    TEXT    -- 'github' | 'clawhub' | 'user-created'
security_status    TEXT    -- 'unscanned' | 'clean' | 'flagged' | 'blocked'
security_scan_at   INTEGER -- Timestamp of last security scan
```

---

## 9. Recommendations for Our Platform

### 9.1 High Priority

1. **Add frontmatter validation** to the AI Composer to enforce convention naming rules (1-64 chars, lowercase, hyphens, no consecutive hyphens).

2. **Support `allowed-tools` in generated skills** so users can specify tool permissions during skill creation.

3. **Add a prerequisites display** on skill detail pages showing required binaries, environment variables, and configuration.

4. **Implement basic security scanning** for imported skills, checking for known malicious patterns in SKILL.md body and bundled scripts.

### 9.2 Medium Priority

5. **Build a CLI tool** (`npx agentskills install <slug>`) that auto-detects installed agents and places skills in the correct directories.

6. **Support `requirements` in AI Composer** so users can declare what their skill depends on.

7. **Add skill type classification** to distinguish between auto-invoked skills and user-invoked slash commands.

8. **Import skills from ClawHub/GitHub** with proper format validation and security scanning.

### 9.3 Low Priority

9. **Support `metadata` extensibility** for platform-specific fields (OpenClaw emoji, install instructions).

10. **Add `model` field support** for skills that require specific AI models.

11. **Implement skill versioning** to track changes over time and allow rollback.

12. **Build a trust/reputation system** with verified authors, community audits, and provenance tracking.

---

## 10. Summary

The Agent Skill Convention is a well-designed open standard that our platform already partially supports. The main gaps are:

| Area | Status | Priority |
|------|--------|----------|
| Basic SKILL.md format | Compatible | - |
| Strict name validation | Missing | High |
| `allowed-tools` support | Missing | High |
| `requirements` system | Missing | Medium |
| CLI installer | Missing | Medium |
| Security scanning | Missing | High |
| Skill/command type distinction | Missing | Medium |
| `metadata` extensibility | Missing | Low |
| `model` field | Missing | Low |

The biggest risk in adopting convention skills is **security**. The ClawHub ecosystem has documented cases of malware distribution through skills. Any import mechanism must include security scanning before making skills available on our platform.
